To run my program input arguments as specified in the FAQ sheet, including the memory constraint as
a final parameter (non-optional). Please run it using the file PreProc.py and python3. Make sure to have
special.py in the same directory The machine it runs on will need to have NLTK installed (used for stopwords
and the Porter Stemmer). Getting NLTK integrated properly with my program took some head-scratching so if
something goes wrong for you there please reach out. I've been using relative file paths for the input and
output files during my coding, but I don't see any reason why absolute ones shouldn't work. Lastly, to
simulate unlimited memory just give a very high memory constraint, it'll error if you don't supply one
(sorry didn't get around to input checking on thisone). That should be all.
